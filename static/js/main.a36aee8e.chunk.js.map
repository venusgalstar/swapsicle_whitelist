Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n       </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default TermsConditionsText;\r\n","import Disclaimer from '../home/Disclaimer';\r\nimport TermsOfUse from '../home/TermsOfUse';\r\nimport TermsConditions from '../home/TermsConditions';\r\nimport { useState } from 'react';\r\n\r\nexport const Footer = () => {\r\n    const [showModalDisclaimer, setShowModalDisclaimer] = useState();\r\n    const [showModalTermsOfUse, setShowModalTermsOfUse] = useState();\r\n    const [showModalTermsConditions, setShowModalTermsConditions] = useState();\r\n    return (\r\n        <footer>\r\n            <div className=\"left\">\r\n                <a href=\"https://twitter.com/swapsiciedex?s=21\"><i className=\"fa-brands fa-twitter\"></i></a>\r\n                <a href=\"https://instagram.com/swapsicledex?utm_medium=copy_link\"><i className=\"fa-brands fa-instagram\"></i></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"center\">\r\n                {/* <a href=\"#\" onClick={() => setShowModalDisclaimer(!showModalDisclaimer)}><span>Risk Disclaimer</span></a> */}\r\n                <a href=\"#\" onClick={() => setShowModalTermsOfUse(!showModalTermsOfUse)}><span>Terms of Use</span></a>\r\n                <a href=\"#\" onClick={() => setShowModalTermsConditions(!showModalTermsConditions)}><span>Terms & Conditions</span></a>\r\n                <a href=\"#\"><span>Privacy & Cookies</span></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n            {showModalDisclaimer && (\r\n        <Disclaimer\r\n          handleClose={() => setShowModalDisclaimer(!showModalDisclaimer)}\r\n        />\r\n      )}\r\n      {showModalTermsOfUse && (\r\n        <TermsOfUse\r\n          handleClose={() => setShowModalTermsOfUse(!showModalTermsOfUse)}\r\n        />\r\n      )}\r\n        {showModalTermsConditions && (\r\n        <TermsConditions\r\n          handleClose={() => setShowModalTermsConditions(!showModalTermsConditions)}\r\n        />\r\n      )}\r\n            \r\n            <img className=\"popsicle threePop\" src=\"/img/threePop.png\"/>\r\n            <img className=\"popsicle onePop\" src=\"/img/onePop.png\"/>\r\n            <img className=\"popsicle twoPop\" src=\"/img/twoPop.png\"/>\r\n            <img className=\"popsicle fourPop\" src=\"/img/onePop.png\"/>\r\n               \r\n        </footer>\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Footer;","import StatefulComponent from \"../StatefulComponent\";\r\nimport { connect } from \"react-redux\";\r\n\r\nclass ProjectDescription extends StatefulComponent {\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <>\r\n                <div className=\"project-description\">\r\n                    <img className=\"swapPresale\" src=\"/img/swapsicle-presale.png\" alt=\"Swapsicle Logo\"/>\r\n                    {\r\n                        this.props.imageUrl ?\r\n                            <div className=\"project-image\"><img src={this.props.imageUrl} alt={this.props.name}/></div>\r\n                            : (!this.props.name ?
